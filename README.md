## Graphics Vector Field Project
Project for CS 6491 Computer Graphics at Georgia Tech. This project was a two-man group effort with Steven Hillerman (also currently a GT student). Base code for 2D rendering was provided by the instructor: Jarek Rossignac.

This project showcases concepts from Computer Graphics, using a significant number of applications of geometry and operations from linear algebra.

This project is coded in Java and needs software called Processing for actual rendering. If you'd like to run the code yourself, download Processing at: https://processing.org/, download the code posted above, open "base2D.pde," and run it in Processing.

Depending on your screen resolution, you might want to change the window size (it is defined in the "base2D.pde" code on line 58.)
